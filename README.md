Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  Gaming Room is a game developer that is just getting started in video game design and development. Gaming Room wants a web based game that enables multiple people to play the base game with multiple unique teams and games. They needed a group of game servers that interfaced with a lightwieght client that the user could use while the game servers provided the heavy lifting.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  The Evaluation of different platforms for specific portions of the achetecture was my strongest. Having a background in system administration across multiple platforms, I was able to leverage that expereince to provide a solid and non technical explanation to the strenghts and weaknesses of the assoiciated platforms and tasks.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It helped flesh out alot in terms of how to get the software to communicate across the various functions and methods. By having a good idea of how the software was to operate, it influenced the details in how the parts of the program interacted with each out.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part that I would like to revise would be the server-side reccomendations. I feel that there could be improvement to how the concept I was going for was described and explained. Additionally, I would have like to revisisted it again with a mind towards possible simplifying the overall achetecture more so that I had initially done.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took what the user had stated and translated that into how the code would function. There was some back and forth to remove any misunderstandings or unclear options that the user wanted. This is important because, firstly, they are paying for it, ultimately, and , secondly, because there is a sense of pride in fulfilling the requirements set out before you. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Drawing comparisions to previous expereince and knowledge can be the easiest way to analyze and design software applications. Additionally, speaking with peers and looking at other projects that share requirements can also provide other paths to either describe or design new code that can fulfil the unique requirements that the current project requires.
